# Hominids
Created Saturday 16 March 2024

Early hominids appeared on Nalduway 5-10 million years ago with the divergence of human ancestors from the ancestors of other extant species of ape. Not long after (at least on the evolutionary timescale), the primitive hominins developed obligate bipedalism as competition from other arboreal primates likely drove them to seek food on the ground. 

Over time, these ancestral hominids developed from using found items as tools to crafting stone tools for specific purposes. With adaptations that enabled their spread over a large area, these hominins began to diverge into a number of different species (via the process of adaptive radiation). 

Their modern descendents are collectively referred to as humans, and are currently grouped into four species.
