Fossorial Adaptations
---------------------

The early hominid ancestors of Delvers lived in and around the [Great Desert](../../Nalduway/Notosia/Great_Desert.md), where they faced environmental pressures which led to a fossorial (subterranian) lifestyle. Their small body size increased their surface-area-to-volume-ration, accellerating heat loss. Reduced size was also advantageous to burrowing, which provides additional protection from the sun as well as from predation.

The facial hair that Delvers are known for, rather than being a sexually dimorphic trait as in many other Hominids, actually consists of whiskers that help them navigate in close confines, as well as serving as a crude air filter for dust and debris. Its presence on all sexes leads to a great deal of confusion for outsiders, who have mistakenly assumed the species to be entirely male.

In addition to whiskers, Delvers also possess a keen sense of echolocation, something present on some level in most humans but which their ancestors heavily relied on to navigate dark subterranean environments. As a result, they possess exceptional spatial reasoning abilities and are often able to perform dead reckoning operations with a high degree of accuracy, both above and below ground.

Another common misconception is that Delvers are blind or have poorer vision than other Humans. In fact, they inherited the well-developed night vision of their ancestor homo noctis, which they share with the Luren. They do, however, have higher rates of colorblindness.

Society
-------

Delvers formed some of the earliest settled societies on Nalduway, with a particular bent towards loose associations of city-states with a trade-based economy.

Delver family groups are extremely matriarchal, with individuals other than the matriarch and her partners experiencing reproductive suppression. As such, most Delver societies recognize three main genders, with the vast majority of the population being considered “neuter” or androgynous, lacking pronounced secondary sex traits. 

The [ancient Delver city-states](../../History/Ancient_Delver_City-States.md) near they Pyrinean Sea are the location one of the indepentent origins of writing. Logographs carved in stone and other hard materials could be read either by touch or sight, and developed into a more phonetic system over a great length of time.


* Subspecies for different levels of subterranean life/divergence due to separate cave environments?
* Arcane art - “Masonry” aka rearranging the composition of minerals to facilitate building - Delver cities are lined with dense basalt-like rock which results from less dense rock being compacted to make chambers larger;
