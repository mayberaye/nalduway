# Undines
Created Saturday 16 March 2024

The ancestors of the Undines radiated into the niche of a semiaquatic hunter. Their ancestors lived in Nalduway’s large intertidal zones, subsisting on the rich ecosystem that becomes exposed during low tide. Initially, these ancestral hominids were forced to retreat inland during high tide, but over time, they developed characteristics which enabled them to range further into the sea and tae advantage of richer ecosystems in the low tide zone and beyond. The nature of these resources (fish, clams, etc) means that the Undine diet 

 They developed the ability to hold their breath for extended periods of time, facilitate by more efficient blood filtration and higher tolerance for anoxia (a trait which convergently evolved in homo noctis for high-altitude life). They also developed a body plan better adapted for swimming, at the cost of some ease of movement on land. Nonetheless, they still spend a significant amount of time on land for a variety of purposes, including mating and trade with other Humans.

Undines possess a basic form of electroreception thru mechanoreceptors evolved from hairs on the skin, providing them with an elevated awareness of their surroundings in low-light aquatic conditions. 

Historically, Undines were often mistaken for shapeshifters by land-dwellers, who may have been confused by the Undines use of sealskins, believing these skins where what granted the Undines their aquatic traits. Undines may also appear femine to land-dwellers due to a lack of facial hair, leading to their mistaken labeling as “mermaids.”
