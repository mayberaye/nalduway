# Great Dragons
Created Saturday 16 March 2024

Dragons emerged deep in Nalduway’s past, far, far earlier than any human. They are often considered the world’s “original” inhabitants, being descended from Nalduway’s equivalent of pterosaurs, which convergently evolved some surface-level similarities to squamates and birds.

Due to their quadrupedal anatomy, with bat-like wing membranes and claws, early dragons were better suited than large birds for takeoff and landing, and therefore dominated as large aerial scavengers and predators, particularly in the open plains, where large birds lie condors struggled to function without high points for easy takeoff. 

In this environment many proto-dragons developed a habit of fire-chasing, as wildfires would scatter and panic prey, making them easier to catch. As this hunting strategy proved more and more beneficial, dragons eventually learned how to wield and create fire themselves - a practice which led early humans (who may have evolved along similar fire-related lines) to mistakenly describe them as “breathing” fire.

As they gained supremacy in the skies, dragons also increasingly shifted to a k-strategy of reproduction, having fewer offspring into which they invested more resources, both biological and social. Dragons typically lay only a single to a few, large eggs at a time, with the parents bringing food to the young hatchlings until they are old enough to fend for themselves.

Arcana Draconis
---------------

Dragons have a special relationship with [arcana](../../Science_&_Technology/Arcana.md) due to their sensitivity to arcane energy. This extra perception allows them to interact with spirits more easily than Hominids do. As such, Dragons have a strong affinity for what Hominids call [Blood Magic](../../Science_&_Technology/Blood_Magic.md), being themselves technically a symbiotic hybrid between their biological selves and a spirit-self.

Draconolatry
------------

Some early hominid cultures held dragons in high regard, even going so far as to consider them gods. Early blood mages often claimed draconic lineage to increase their reputations, despite the implausibility of such an interspecies union.

The [Cult of the Sentinels](../../Religion/Cult_of_the_Sentinels.md) considers dragon-worship to be highly heretical due to the association between dragons and "evil" magic.

Draconic Culture and Society
----------------------------

Dragons are less prone to forming large groups than hominids are, and their intelligence is quite different. As such, their numbers have always been lesser, and they tend to adopt a "live and let live" philosophy, living reclusively in the wild parts of the world and forming bonds mainly of necessity or unusual fondness for one another.

Dragons can be described as "facultative" social creatures as opposed to "obligate" social creatures which require the support of a group for basic survival.

Due to their magical nature dragons also live much longer lives than nonmagical hominids. As such they have observed much of the unfolding of history and often serve as primary sources for various records. This role as lorekeepers is enhanced by their ability to pass on memories from one generation to the next.
