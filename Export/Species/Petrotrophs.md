# Petrotrophs
Created Saturday 23 March 2024

Petrotrophs are one of the primary kingdoms of life on Nalduway. Existing primarily in areas of high arcane radiation, they are multicellular [chemoautotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotroph#Chemoautotroph), and form the basis of the food chain in underground ecosystems, where they occupy the niches of primary producers and also play a major role in shaping their environment.

Petrotrophs use a variety of methods to extract energy from the rock.
