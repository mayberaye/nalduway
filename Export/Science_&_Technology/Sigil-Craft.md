Created Tuesday 19 March 2024

A system of arcane manipulation passed down from the Sentinels. It consists of an entire symbolic language through which the force of [arcana](./Arcana.md) is manipulated. Despite its religiously significant origins, the system has come to be studied scientifically, with experimentation and the development of new or more efficient spells.
