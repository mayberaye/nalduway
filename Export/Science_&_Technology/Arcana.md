# Arcana
Created Saturday 16 March 2024

Arcane energy has the power to manipulate probability, within the limits of causality. Much of this energy is concentrated in the form of arcane being of “spirits” - whose interactions with the rest of the world can be somewhat unpredictable. The Arcane Arts, then, are the means by which this energy can be harnessed, influenced, and directed.

History of the Arcane Arts
--------------------------

The very earliest magic was likely rooted in the collective unconscious. The impulses and desires of a population would have been manifested in entelechea – spirits which become imprinted with ideas and emotional residue of living beings. Physical idols, fetishes, totems, etc could serve as a focus for the psychological forces at work – as could natural features like water bodies or geological formations.

The next stage would have been shamanistic, as individuals learned to channel the power of spirits directly. They would have used various ritual, meditative, and totemic aids to focus their mentality and elicit the desired effect.

Using various objects for shamanic rituals would have led to the discovery that some materials actually conduct psychic energy better than others, and in different ways. Metals like copper are pure conductors, as with electricity. Electrolytic materials such as calcium have more static properties, and tend to take psychic impressions. Bones found use as relics, and limestone and marble were among the first materials used in enchanting – the process of imprinting a spell into a physical object for later use.
