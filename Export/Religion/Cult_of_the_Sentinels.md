# Cult of the Sentinels
Created Monday 25 March 2024

The [Sentinels](./Cult_of_the_Sentinels/Sentinels.md)are an elusive order who came to prominence with the [Blood Wars](../History/Blood_Wars.md) and the subsequent civilizational collapse. Per tradition, the [Infernal Dominion](./Cult_of_the_Sentinels/Infernal_Dominion.md) was ruled by demonic despots who oppressed mortals and offended the gods, who defeated them in a great battle that also resulted in the destruction of the whole world. Seeing the suffering their fighting had caused, the gods retreated from the mortal world, only leaving behind the Sentinels to watch over the world in their absence.

The Cult of the Sentinels is sometimes seen as a branch of  [Ancient Nierunic Paganism](./Ancient_Nierunic_Paganism.md) and shares a common pantheon, but differs significantly in many of its beliefs and practices.

The [Solar Calendar](../Science_&_Technology/Solar_Calendar.md) begins with the traditional date of the Dominion's defeat as Year 1 - this is based on the calculations of ancient scholars and does not necessarily line up with more recent historical consensus about the Blood Wars.


History
-------

The Blood Wars are a matter of historical record, but the lore surrounding them is dubious and full of unreliable sources. It is thought that many of the records pertaining to these events seek to establish a cultural and mythological interpretation of the traumatic events, rather than to present an accurate historical record. This mythology  may have then served as a basis for the rebuilding of society in the aftermath of near total destruction and the founding of the [Nierunic Empire](../History/Nierunic_Empire.md).

Although the Blood Wars are considered to be the true origin of the faith, it first appears in the historical record in [year].

* Great Charter - book of divine law
* Book of Deeds - records of the activities of the Sentinels throughout history
