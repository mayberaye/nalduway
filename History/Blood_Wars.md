# Blood Wars
Created Monday 25 March 2024

Historical wars fought between powerful practitioners of Blood Magic. Highly mythologized and held responsible for the civilizational collapse that occured around the [Pyrinean Sea](../Nalduway/Notosia/Pyrinean_Sea.md) towards the end of the BCE era.

What has been mythologized as the Infernal Dominion was probably actually a number of city-states and petty kingdoms who fought one another until the lineage who would become the Sentinels emerged as the victors/last survivors, and then retreated to [the Axis of the World](../Nalduway/Transarctica/Axis_of_the_World.md) where they have reclusively lived ever since.
