====== Nalduway ======

===== Nalduway =====

{{./Nalduway-satelite.png?width=500}}

Nalduway is an Earth-like planet, ie one which  a magnetic field that shields its surface from cosmic radiation and experiences tectonic processes, both important factors which allow the existence of carbon-based life.

Mass - Earth-like
Circumference - Earth-like
Axial Tilt - 22.5 (additional stability provided by multiple/larger moons?)
Composition: Terrestrial (composed primarily of metals and silicates)

===== Moons and Tidal Forces =====

Multiple moons in orbital resonance 
Monthly moon (relatively close to a single earth month)
Seasonal moon (4-6 times a year)
Longer moon?

===== The Cosmic Landscape =====

==== Requirements [TEMP] ====

* Star is sufficiently bright for photosynthesis
* Starâ€™s habitable zone exists long enough for complex life to evolve
* Sufficient material present for formation of earth-like planets
* Tidal stresses do not negatively effect planetary temperature or stability
* Planet must have an iron core to produce magnetic field, shielding life forms from radiation
* Planet must have sufficient mass and liquid water content for plate tectonics
* Only 10% of sunlike stars might have gas giants ,and they normally form outside the ice line, rarely hot jupiters migrate closer 
* The Galaxy
* Galactic habitable zone = not so close to the active galactic core as to be bombarded by supernovae/radiation, not so far as to lack access to elements produced by supernovae
* Zone is small in young galaxies, and expands with age
