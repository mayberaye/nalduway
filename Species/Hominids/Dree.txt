====== Dree ======
Created Saturday 16 March 2024

Dree are the hominins that remained in the mixed savannah environment where their ancestors first evolved. They evolved to specialize in hunting the many savannah animals using complex, highly coordinated strategies; they also became far taller than the common hominid ancestor who stood around 4ft tall on average, making them less of an easy target for predators along with their skills with weapons.

In recent millennia, some Dree have followed the Delvers in developing settled, urban societies. Unlike the Delvers, these settlements are generally built aboveground, as many Dree find Delver-style cities to be claustrophobic and disorienting in their close confines and lack of sunlight. Their affinity for the open sun sets them apart from other humans, who sometimes refer to them as “sun-mad” to explain seemingly unpredictable behavior.

===== Etymology =====

From old Scottish English verb meaning “to endure”. Reference to the species’ physical endurance or to their ability to “endure” bright sun (from the perspective of other species)
