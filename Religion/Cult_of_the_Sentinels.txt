Seeing the suffering their fighting had caused, the gods retreated from the mortal world, only leaving behind the Sentinels to watch over the world in their absence.

The Cult of the Sentinels is sometimes seen as a branch of  [[:Religion:Ancient Nierunic Paganism|Ancient Nierunic Paganism]] and shares a common pantheon, but differs significantly in many of its beliefs and practices.
