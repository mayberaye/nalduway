# Luren
Created Saturday 16 March 2024

These hominids have adapted to hunt at night and in general low light conditions, which increases the success of ambush tactics., and is beneficial in polar regions where days become extremely short during winter. They frequently have reduced color vision as a side effect of their enhanced night vision, and naturally tend towards being active at night.

Though they originated in polar and glacial regions,  Lurens have spread throughout the world’s alpine regions as well, and as such, they’re commonly viewed as “mountain men” or “wild folk” by both Dree and Delvers.
