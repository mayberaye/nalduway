====== Vitreolites ======
Created Saturday 16 March 2024

 Sulfuric acid is a major byproduct of the vitreolites’ metabolism, and wears away at bedrock, creating caves. These caves then come to be inhabited by other organisms which feed on the vitreolites and their byproducts.

Early vitreolites were little more than microbial mats in the ocean, producing the occasional [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromatolite|stromatolite]]. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snottite#:~:text=Snottite%2C%20also%20snoticle%2C%20is%20a,the%20consistency%20of%20nasal%20mucus.|Upon entering terrestrial cave systems]], vitreolites began to develop more complex structures to help them maximalize the absorption of sulfur, resembling “roots” to extract solid mineral deposits and “leaves” to extract gaseous compounds. Many vitreolites resemble moss or lichen, hence the common name **brimmoss**.

===== Domestication =====

A number of vitreolite species have been cultivated by [[Hominids:Delvers|Delvers]] both for livestock feed and for their sulfuric acid waste, which as a number of industrial applications. This is credited as enabling the early development of industry in Delver civilizations.

===== Taxonomy =====

* Vitreoplankton  - found in subterranean water and within porous limestone.
* Brimmoss - herbaceous-looking and eaten by large grazers. Like fungi, the visible portion is only the fruiting body of a much larger root system.
* Rhizomorphs - rootlike structures that burrow into and corrode rock; lacking the large fruiting bodies of Brimmoss
