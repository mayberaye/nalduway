====== Blood Magic ======
Created Monday 25 March 2024

the name is a misnomer because magic is transmitted through "bloodlines", but its not genetic or really connected to blood at all. it may or may not even refer to a single magical practice, rather than a later construct lumping several different practices together.
magic is stored in the bones
transmitted thru mammalian pregnancy bc the fetus steals its mothers bones
stigmatized because of its association with the Infernal Dominion
