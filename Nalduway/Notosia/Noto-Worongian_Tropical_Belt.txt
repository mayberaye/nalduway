Created Friday 22 March 2024

===== Foodways =====

==== Agriculture & Horticulture ====

In areas with a dry season, slash-and-burn agriculture is a common practice, which when properly executed helps enrich the soil with biochar and ensure a decade-or-more long cycle of crop rotation. The long term planning involved in this style of land management has formed the basis of many societies.

Common crops in this region include:
* yams (various species of Dioscorea)
* cowpeas
* chickpeas
* millet & sorghum
* rice
* sugarcane
* plantain/banana (numerous poorly-defined cultivars of species in the genus Musa)
	* note: one variety, abac√°, is cultivated for fibers in its leaf sheaths which produce a soft, lustrous, silk-like textile of the same name
* coconut
* coffee
* tea
* jackfruit & breadfruit
* pineapple
* taro
* citrus fruits
* figs
* melons
* several species of pepper (related to black pepper, not chilis)
* arrowroot
* ginger
* turmeric
* sweet potatoes
* sugar palm
* oil palm
* mango & related fruits

==== Hunting & FIshing ====

Fishing provides a crucial source of protein in coastal and river areas. Fishing boats are produced with timber from numerous species of cultivated trees.
