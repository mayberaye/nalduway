# Axis of the World
Created Saturday 16 March 2024

"And then, as we looked upon the sky, it seemed that the heavens themselves parted and presented us with a holy sign. A great curtain of fire appeared in the sky and fluttered about in movements so glorious that your servant could never pen words sufficient to describe them. The holy men in our company determined that this was indeed an omen of blessing from Our Lady, and we pressed on."

-- excerpt from the Book of Aranith, describing the sighting of an aurora by the general and his expeditionary force.<

Geography
---------
he Axis of the World is most properly a name given to the south pole, but which also applies to the surrounding glacial and tundra regions. It is located on the continent of Dolmilin.

Fauna & Flora
-------------

Due to permafrost in the soil, this region supports no large plants such as trees or shrubs. Instead, the flora is mostly grass and moss and plants with shallow root systems, which in turn feed grazing animals such as the caribou. The grazing herds are prey for large carnivores such as bears and wolves, while smaller animals such as rabbits are hunted by foxes and birds of prey.

Natural Resources
-----------------

Due to the presence of the South Polar Nexus, the region has an abundance of wild magic. This is of great import to the Sentinels, who practice mystic arts which rely on this energy.   The caribou herds are also an important food source for the Sentinels and for local  [Luren](../../Species/Hominids/Luren.md) tribes.
